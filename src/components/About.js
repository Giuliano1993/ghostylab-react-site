      <p>Hi, I'm <b>Giuliano</b> and I'm a <b>freelance full stack web developer</b> based in Rome.</p>
      <p>I learnt coding when I was a young kid, just for play and have fun. As my love for code dates so back, I still love coding as much as a kid loves playing with costructions: I love <b>building things</b>, see them coming to <b>life</b>.</p>
      <p>I develop <b>websites and web apps as well as command line tools</b> useful for server management and more complex tasks.</p>
      <p>I love taking care of the whole process, from design to deploy, and this allows me to have a deep knowledge and understanding of the project I'm working on.</p>
